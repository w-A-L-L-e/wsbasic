wsbasic is a BASIC interpreter written in C++ using recursive descent OO techniques instead of the outdated lex/yacc tools. It can already be used as a scripting replacement for bash and was also used as basis for kturtle's logo interpreter. Can act as a replacement for bash or sh scripting.

Originally released on sourceforge and freecode.com over 19 years ago in 2000:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsbasic/
http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/wsbasic

Later forked and used by kturtle project of KDE:
https://kde.org/applications/education/kturtle/

Cleaned up and made to compile again on latest Xcode in 2019:
```
gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin18.5.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

```

Most likely still compiles on linux with regular gcc and on windows using mingw ;).

As stated in the original release this is a GPL project.
